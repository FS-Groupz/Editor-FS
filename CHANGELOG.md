  - High-performance native Android media playback pipeline with SurfaceTexture preview.
  - Interactive spatial transform canvas with pan, pinch-to-zoom, rotate, and horizontal/vertical flip.
  - Smart multi-layer alignment guides and magnetic center/edge auto-snapping.
  - Hardware-accelerated GPU shader transitions (12 styles) and 1080P MP4 export engine.
  - Non-destructive split-cut, ripple delete, clip duplicate, and universal multi-level undo/redo history.
  - Text-To-Speech (TTS) integration, sound effects library, and local draft persistence.
- **Architectural Stability**: 100% preservation of application ID, native bridges, MethodChannels, and security configurations.

## [2.4.11] - 2026-09-11

### 🏷️ Global App Branding Fix
- **Official App Name**: Renamed user-facing Android application display name to **Editor FS** across launcher, App Info, settings, and task switcher.
- **Android Manifest & Resources**: Added `@string/app_name` resource (`Editor FS`) and explicitly declared `android:label="@string/app_name"` on both `<application>` and `<activity android:name=".MainActivity">`.
- **Release Automation**: Updated GitHub Actions release workflow title and artifacts to reflect Editor FS.
- **Preserved Internal Compatibility**: Preserved all internal package IDs (`com.example.capcut_video_editor`), MethodChannels (`com.mahmas.studio/*`), backward compatibility typedefs, and keystore configurations.

### 🚀 Highlights & Major Features
- **Real-Time Visual Transition Rendering Engine**: Full multi-layer dual-video preview compositing with 12 distinct GPU-accelerated transition shaders (Fade, Dissolve, Slide Left/Right/Up/Down, Wipe Left/Right, Zoom In/Out, Flash Black/White).
- **Hardware-Accelerated Transition Export Pipeline**: Video compositing during gallery export embedding transition effects directly into exported MP4 media using Android MediaCodec & OpenGL ES.
- **Timeline Playhead Synchronization Engine**: Fixed playhead drift during playback by binding the timeline scrubber clock directly to native ExoPlayer position updates, with hard boundary clamping and zero end-of-clip drift.
- **CapCut-Like Split & Ripple Delete Engines**: Non-destructive split-cut trimming with adjacent transition validation and automatic ripple cleanup.
- **Full Test Suite & Quality Assurance**: 263/263 unit and widget tests passing with 0 static analysis issues. Verified on physical hardware (Realme RMX5003).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### 🚀 Major Milestones & Architectural Redesign

#### Centralized MediaAsset Architecture
- Introduced canonical `MediaAsset` repository pattern across all timeline layers (`VideoClip`, `AudioTrack`, `OverlayClip`, `TextOverlay`).
- Decoupled timeline UI from raw file URIs and filesystem paths.
- Streamed Android Photo Picker `content://` URIs via native `ContentResolver` into private app storage (`context.filesDir/media/`).
- Automated native metadata extraction (precise duration probing and video frame thumbnail generation) via `MediaMetadataRetriever`.

#### Hardware-Accelerated Video Layer Controls
- **Playback**: Integrated Android `MediaPlayer` with `SurfaceTexture` / `Flutter Texture` for smooth zero-lag preview.
- **Speed Control**: Implemented dynamic variable speed scaling (0.25x – 4.0x) modifying native `MediaPlayer.playbackParams.speed` and recalculating active clip duration.
- **Volume Control**: Added per-clip volume slider (0% – 100%) mapped directly to native `MediaPlayer.setVolume()`, isolated per video clip.
- **Trimming**: Implemented non-destructive start/end trimming via draggable timeline handles and Toolbar quick-actions.
- **Split & Duplicate**: Implemented split at playhead (Part 1 & Part 2) and clip duplication to main timeline or PIP overlay.
- **Deletion**: Safe clip removal and automatic timeline duration recalculation.

#### Audio Layer Controls & Multi-Track Engine
- Supported direct local audio file import (`.mp3`, `.wav`, `.m4a`, `.aac`, `.ogg`).
- Multi-track timeline synchronization allowing external audio tracks to coexist with embedded video sound.
- Full audio editing: Split, Trim Left/Right, Speed (0.5x – 2.0x), Volume slider (0% – 100%), Mute toggle, Duplicate, and Delete.
- Auto-play prevention on track import to preserve user timeline positioning.

#### Text & Subtitle System
- Canvas text overlay rendering with real-time scaling, font sizing, and color swatches.
- Timeline integration supporting Text Split, Duplicate, Speed, and Delete.
- Integrated Android native `TextToSpeech` service for voice synthesis.

#### Project Persistence & Drafts Dashboard
- Automatic JSON project serialization (`ProjectStorageService`) on every timeline action.
- HomeScreen dashboard displaying recent drafts with real video thumbnails, durations, and clip counts.
- Seamless project reopening and state restoration.

#### UI & Clean-up
- Cleaned Add Clip media picker to display **only genuine user-imported media** (`Videos` and `Photos`).
- Removed all mock demo lists, sample assets, and fake dummy file generators.
- Removed legacy "Canvases" drawer and tab to streamline editing workflows.
- Fixed layout constraints in timeline clips preventing text and badge overflows on small clips.

### 🧪 Quality Assurance
- **Static Analysis**: `flutter analyze` completed with `0` issues.
- **Automated Tests**: `86/86` unit and widget tests passing.
- **Hardware Verification**: Verified live on physical Realme RMX5003 (Android 16 / API 36).
